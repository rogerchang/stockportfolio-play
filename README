To start it up, go to the project root and run:
./activator run

Once the play app starts up, go to
http://localhost:9000/stockportfolio

The app is hardcoded to send YHOO:1 when you go to that page.
You can update the portfolio via the websocket by opening the browser console and sending something like this:
ws.send(JSON.stringify({"portfolioElements":{"YHOO":"1", "GRPN":"5"}}))
This will update your portfolio to 1 Yahoo share and 5 Groupon shares

Note that this is still a work in progress so there are still bugs.
